# Data Science & Data Engineering Projects

Welcome! This repository contains a selection of Jupyter notebooks and small projects I worked on during my Master's studies in Data Science. These materials represent part of my learning journey and are shared here to give an outline of the topics I've explored.

⚠️ **Note:** These projects are not intended to reflect my current level of expertise—I've grown significantly since completing them. Instead, think of this as a snapshot of foundational concepts I’ve worked with and built upon over time.

## 🔍 What's Inside

You'll find a variety of topics covered, including:

* Data preprocessing and analysis in Python
* Introductory machine learning workflows
* SQL and basic database operations
* Early explorations in data engineering

## 📌 What's Not Here (But I've Worked On)

To keep this repository focused and lightweight (it would be a mess to find all projects and get them under version control in an organized manner), I haven't included all the work I’ve done. Some key areas missing from this repo but covered during my degree include:

* Distributed data processing with **PySpark**
* Working with **NoSQL databases**, especially **MongoDB**
* Advanced machine learning and **deep learning** projects

If you'd like to hear more about these, feel free to reach out!

## 💬 Contact
