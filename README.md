# Data Science & Data Engineering Projects

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of notebooks and small projects completed during my Master's degree in Data Science. These works document part of my learning journey and are shared to provide insight into the topics and techniques I've explored.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: All content in this repository is written in **Spanish**.

While these projects do not reflect my current level of expertise—I’ve significantly developed my skills since completing them—they offer a snapshot of the foundations I built during my studies.

## 🗂️ Project Overview

Here’s a brief summary of the contents:

* **🧠 Examen RNN, MLP y CNN**
  A pair of exams focused on demonstrating familiarity with different types of neural networks: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

* **🚢 ML End2End**
  A full end-to-end machine learning workflow using the Titanic dataset. Covers data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation—designed to show a complete ML pipeline.

* **📊 ML: Modelo y gráficos descriptivos comunes**
  An analysis applying several ML models, discussing common issues such as overfitting, and demonstrating approaches to mitigate them.

* **🏋️ ML General**
  A general-purpose predictive modeling project on obesity-related data, focusing on building a robust ML workflow.

* **🌦️ Series temporales**
  Time series modeling using weather data from Delhi. This early project doesn't include more advanced modeling techniques (e.g., RNNs or SARIMA with Fourier terms), but I reflect on these limitations and discuss how I'd approach it now with what I’ve learned.

* **🗄️ SQL**
  A database design project using MySQL. Includes schema definition, constraints via triggers, and sample queries and views to support meaningful data exploration.

## 📌 What’s Not Included (But I’ve Worked On)

Some topics I’ve studied and applied aren't represented in this repository:

* Distributed processing with **PySpark**
* Working with **NoSQL databases** (e.g., **MongoDB**)
* More advanced ML and **deep learning** models

I'm happy to discuss these or provide examples—just reach out!
